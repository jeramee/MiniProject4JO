INF601 - Advanced Programming in Python

<br>Mini Project 4

## Description
This project, Mini Project 4, is a Django-based web application 
developed for the INF601 course. 
It serves as a private site with plans to include a basic rubric 
for the class and later expand to private chat features. 
The concept is similar to a private site for communication, 
with a touch of humor about "me and donuts."
